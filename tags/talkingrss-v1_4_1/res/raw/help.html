<H3>How it works</H3>

<P><B>Talking RSS Reader</B> fetches a feed of articles from
<a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>
and shows articles one by one, in reverse chronological order.

<P>It begins reading each article out loud as soon as it is
displayed. The sentence currently being spoken is colored in green.

<P>Speech can be interrupted and restarted by pressing
the <I>CALL</I> or <I>SEARCH</I> button,
or the pause button at the bottom center of the screen.

<P>To move to the previous or next sentence, spin the trackball up
or down while the app is talking.

<P>If the text is scrolled, speech will pick up at the first full
sentence from the top of the screen.

<P>Links can be selected with the finger, or trackball when the app
is not talking. Clicking a link launches the browser, which does not talk.

<P>You can have sentences spoken one at a time by holding
the <I>CALL</I> or <I>SEARCH</I> button and spinning the trackball up or down.

<P>The <I>Next</I> and <I>Prev</I> article buttons are located at the
bottom corners of the screen, where they can easily be tapped without
looking. Each article is marked as <I>read</I> after you click
<I>Next</I>.

<P>If you are a first time user of
<a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>,
you may need to initialize your account by going to
<a href="http://google.com/reader"><CODE>http://google.com/reader</CODE></a>.

<P><B>Talking RSS Reader</B> requires network connectivity.
