When I branched off from the Eyes-free TTS, work was in progress to
make speech engines pluggable. Work wasn't complete at the rev I
branched from. And now I've extended the API in a direction of my
own. So to avoid dealing with two Android packages, I decided to
revert part of the change and go back to having libespeakengine.so
bundled with the tts Android package. (It's essentially just a path
string in TTSService.java.) As a result, speech engines are not
pluggable in this version of the TTS, and this directory is pretty
much superfluous.
